    Replay Memory is a technique used in Deep Reinforcement Learning to store and reuse past experiences (i.e., state, action, reward, next state tuples).
    It is critical in stabilizing and improving the learning process of RL agentsâ€”especially when using deep neural networks (like in DQN - Deep Q-Networks).
